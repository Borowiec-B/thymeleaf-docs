% Standard URL Syntax
% The Thymeleaf Team




The Thymeleaf standard dialects — called _Standard_ and _SpringStandard_ — offer
a way to easily create URLs in your web application so that they include any
required _URL preparation_ artifacts. This is done by means of the so-called
_"at" syntax of the standard expressions_: `@{...}`
