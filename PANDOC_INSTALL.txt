HOW TO INSTALL AN UPDATED VERSION OF PANDOC ON LINUX
----------------------------------------------------

1. Install the environment
   Ubuntu 14.10
     - Install ghc, libghc-zlib-dev libgmp-dev packages
   CentOS 6.5
     - Install an updated ghc from https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ and add its binaries to the path.
     - Install the zlib-devel and gmp-devel packages (i686 + x86_64 versions)
     - Link (symbolic) /usr/lib/libgmp.so as /usr/lib/libgmp.so.10, which will be needed during the execution of the downloaded cabal binary (link can be removed after cabal has been re-compiled).
2. Download cabal executable (binary) from https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html
3. Execute ./cabal update, and then ./cabal install cabal-install
4. Cabal will be installed to $HOME/.cabal/bin/cabal
5. Remove the downloaded binary (use only the new one)
6. Execute .cabal/bin/cabal install pandoc
7. Create symlinks to cabal and pandoc from $HOME/bin and add to PATH.
